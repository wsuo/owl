# Out-of-the-Box Video Surveillance Platform

GoWVP is an open-source GB28181 solution implemented in Go, a network video platform based on the GB28181-2022 standard that also supports 2016/2011 versions, with ONVIF/RTMP/RTSP protocol support.

## Live Demo

|-|-|-|-|

## Use Cases

+ Browser-based camera video playback without plugins
+ Support for GB28181-compliant devices (IP cameras, platforms, NVRs, etc.)
+ Support for non-GB28181 devices (RTSP, RTMP, streaming devices, etc.) - maximize your existing equipment
+ Cross-network video preview
+ Deployment via Docker, Docker Compose, or Kubernetes

## Open Source Libraries

Thanks to @panjjo for the open-source library [panjjo/gosip](https://github.com/panjjo/gosip). GoWVP's SIP signaling is based on this library. Due to underlying encapsulation requirements, it's not a direct dependency but rather included in the pkg package.

Two streaming media servers are supported:

+ @夏楚 [ZLMediaKit](https://github.com/ZLMediaKit/ZLMediaKit)

+ **lalmax-pro** - For Go streaming media needs, contact email xx@golang.space
  - No environment requirements, no static library installation needed, cross-platform compilation support
  - Custom feature development available
  - G711 (G711A/G711U) to AAC transcoding support

Project framework based on @ixugo's [goddd](https://github.com/ixugo/goddd)

## FAQ

> Where are the frontend resources? How to load the web interface?

[Click to download www.zip package](https://github.com/gowvp/gb28181_web/releases/latest)

Download (packaged) frontend resources and place them in the project root directory, named `www` to load properly.

> Black screen when playing

Check "Quick Desktop" - "ZLM settings button (top right)" - "GB28181 stream receiving default address"
Ensure this address is accessible by the surveillance device.

Check "Quick Desktop" - "ZLM settings button (top right)" - "Hook IP"
Can ZLM access GoWVP? For Docker combined version, use 127.0.0.1. For separate deployment, use explicit IP address.

> Channel list shows fewer channels than actual count

By design. More than 4 channels should be viewed in the management page, or click "View More" on the right.

> Using nginx reverse proxy, returned playback addresses don't work or snapshots don't load

Configure the following parameters in reverse proxy (replace domain with your actual one):

proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;

proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Prefix "https://gowvp.com";

proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;

proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

> How to use other databases?

In the `configs/config.toml` configuration file, modify `database.dsn`

[Recommended] SQLite should be a local disk path, default is `configs/data.db`

[Recommended] PostgreSQL format: `postgres://postgres:123456@127.0.0.1:5432/gb28181?sslmode=disable`

MySQL format: `mysql://root:123456@127.0.0.1:5432/gb28181?sslmode=disable`

PostgreSQL and MySQL format pattern:
`<db_type>://<username>:<password>@<ip>:<port>/<db_name>?sslmode=disable`

> How to disable AI?

AI detection is enabled by default, detecting 5 frames per second.

You can disable AI detection by setting `disabledAI = true` in `configs/config.toml`

## Third-Party Authentication

GoWVP supports forwarding authentication requests to a third-party service, ideal for environments with an existing unified authentication system (SSO, OAuth2, corporate account systems, etc.).

**Sequence Diagram**

![](./docs/auth.webp)

**Use Cases**

+ Your organization has a unified login system and you want GoWVP to reuse existing sessions without requiring users to log in again
+ Enterprise intranet environments that need to integrate with LDAP, CAS, OAuth2, or other authentication providers
+ API gateway handles authentication and you want to pass the verification result through to GoWVP

**Configuration**

Set `AuthURL` to your third-party authentication service address in `configs/config.toml`:

```toml
[Server.HTTP]
  AuthURL = "https://your-auth-server.com/api/verify"
```

**How It Works**

Once `AuthURL` is configured, all requests are verified through the third-party authentication service. GoWVP forwards the original request headers and body as a POST to the specified URL. A `200` response means authentication passes; any other status code means failure, and the response body is returned directly to the client.

> Note: The third-party auth service must respond within 10 seconds, otherwise the request is considered timed out.

## ONVIF Virtual Device (Server)

GoWVP can act as an **ONVIF Network Video Transmitter** so integrators (e.g. Home Assistant) can add it like a camera and pull RTSP URLs for platform channels.

### Ports and firewall (LAN)

| Purpose | Protocol | Port | Open in firewall? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Web UI + ONVIF SOAP | TCP | `Server.HTTP.Port` (default **15123**) | Only if HA/NVR is on another subnet; same LAN usually needs no extra rule |
| RTSP playback after `GetStreamUri` | TCP | ZLM RTSP (default **554**, see `docker-compose` mapping) | Same as above when the client pulls stream from ZLM |
| ONVIF WS-Discovery (server advertisement) | UDP | **3702** (multicast `239.255.255.250`) | Map `3702:3702/udp` in Docker; LAN usually needs no extra rule |

ONVIF SOAP endpoints (same HTTP port as the web UI):

- `POST http://<host>:15123/onvif/device_service`
- `POST http://<host>:15123/onvif/media_service`

Authentication uses `Server.Username` / `Server.Password` in `configs/config.toml` (WS-Security `PasswordDigest` or `PasswordText`), same defaults as web login (`admin` / `admin`).

**Home Assistant (manual add):**

- Host: `http://<lan-ip>:15123/onvif/device_service`
- Username / password: values from `config.toml` `Server.Username` / `Server.Password`

**Auto-discovery:** After startup, GoWVP answers WS-Discovery Probe on **UDP 3702**. Set `Media.IP` (or `Sip.Host`) in `configs/config.toml` to your LAN IP so `XAddrs` is reachable from Home Assistant.

**Not the same as** `GET /onvif/discover`: that API lets GoWVP **scan the LAN for external ONVIF cameras** (client role).

## Webhook Alert Push & Receive

GoWVP supports pushing alert events to external systems via HTTP Webhook, and receiving pushes from other GoWVP instances for **master-slave cascading** deployments.

### Endpoint

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/webhook/events` | Unified event receiver, compatible with both Python AI and gowvp-to-gowvp forwarding |

### Configuration (`configs/config.toml`)

```toml
[Server.Webhook]
  # Target URL array; embed the secret as a query parameter
  Targets = [
    "http://192.168.1.100:15123/webhook/events?secret=your-recv-secret",
  ]
  # Max retries, 0 = built-in default of 3
  MaxRetry = 3
  # Channel buffer size per target, 0 = built-in default of 64
  BufferSize = 64
  # Secret for validating incoming webhook requests (auto-generated on first launch)
  RecvSecret = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

### Authentication

`/webhook/events` accepts two authentication methods (either one suffices):

| Source | Method | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Python AI | `Authorization: Basic <InternalSecret>` header | Random UUID generated at startup, not persisted |
| Other gowvp | URL query `?secret=<RecvSecret>` | Configured in `RecvSecret`, auto-generated on first launch |

### Master-Slave Cascading

**Master node**: Receives AI detection events and pushes alerts to slave nodes.

```toml
# Master node config.toml
[Server.Webhook]
  Targets = ["http://<slave-ip>:15123/webhook/events?secret=<slave-RecvSecret>"]
```

**Slave node**: Receives pushes and stores events directly (device/channel existence is not validated).

```toml
# Slave node config.toml (RecvSecret is auto-generated on first launch)
[Server.Webhook]
  RecvSecret = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

### Forward Payload Format (gowvp → gowvp)

```json
{
  "did": "device-id",
  "cid": "channel-id",
  "started_at": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
  "ended_at": "2024-01-01T10:00:01Z",
  "label": "person",
  "score": 0.95,
  "zones": "{\"x_min\":0,\"y_min\":0,\"x_max\":100,\"y_max\":100}",
  "image_base64": "<base64-encoded JPEG image>",
  "model": "yolov8"
}
```

> `image_base64`: The master node reads the local image file and encodes it as base64 for transmission. The slave node decodes and saves it locally, resolving cross-node file path issues.
> If the image cannot be read, `image_base64` is omitted; the event is still saved without an image.

### Retry Strategy

On failure, the push is retried with **exponential backoff ± 25% jitter**:

| Attempt | Base Delay |
|---------|------------|
| 1st | ~1s |
| 2nd | ~2s |
| 3rd | ~4s (max 10s) |

HTTP 4xx responses (except 429/408) are treated as permanent failures and not retried. Each retry failure is logged as `warn`; exhausted retries are logged as `error`.
